# bloom-filters

Bloom filter kata done in Clojure

Not sure how correct the implementation is as a persistent data structure might defeat the entire purpose of a bloom filter; instead of having a big array... we might have multiple arrays (hash-functions count * words stored in the filter). Something to look into.
